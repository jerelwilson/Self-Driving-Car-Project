This was a project I did on Codeacademy, The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it
as a human driver would, but the implementation is fraught with obstacles. To accomplish this, youâ€™ll use your knowledge
of TypeScript object types to apply types to a variety of classes, properties, and methods.

I used Typescript, JSON and Javascript
